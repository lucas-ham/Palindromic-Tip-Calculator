# Palindromic-Tip-Calculator


This is a simple JavaScript tip calculator that always returns the final price to be a palindrome. This is a standard project I always do when learning a new language, steming from one of the first coding projects I ever did. Following the prompts on the site, you can calculate your tip and ensure the price is always a palindrome!
